# Liver_Patient_Prediction
Liver_Patient_Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting liver disease based on patient demographic and biochemical data. It helps in early detection and supports medical professionals in diagnosis using data-driven insights.

### **Business Case**  
This dataset appears to be related to **liver disease prediction or diagnosis**, where various biochemical parameters and demographic data (age, gender) are used to classify patients into two categories (likely **"1" for liver disease presence** and **"2" for no liver disease"**). The dataset can be useful for:  

1. **Medical Diagnosis** â€“ Assisting doctors in diagnosing liver diseases based on lab test results.  
2. **Early Detection** â€“ Identifying patients at risk of developing liver disease for early intervention.  
3. **Healthcare Research** â€“ Analyzing patterns in liver disease occurrences and their relationship with biochemical markers.  
4. **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Developing machine learning models to automate liver disease detection.  

### **Dataset Information**  
- **Number of Rows:** 583  
- **Number of Columns:** 11  
- **Target Variable:** `Target` (Binary classification: 1 = Liver disease, 2 = No liver disease)  
- **Data Type:** Medical/Clinical Dataset
